here at Sky View trading we've created tools to help us make better decisions about when to close our option trades to enhance our returns and we've created these toolsaround specific trading rules we've put in place so in putting this trade into the trade management tool you can see it's signaling me to close the trade because of how fast we've made this profit we've made 39 percent of the premium but have only held the position for 11 percent of the time we are outpacing our expected return by three and a half times and now we can free up the capital and allocate it to a new trade so I'm gonna go ahead and do that now and again you can see I sold theoption for 310 and bought it back to close it from 189 so that's a profit of 121 dollars and that's why I'm such a big fan of active trading during markets like this there's plenty of two-sided action so you can take profits free up the capital for a new trade and rinse and repeat and this is just one small trade of mini with the VIX this high I will continue to strategically trade options like this to capitalize on all the fear that is currently in the market because fear typically trades at apremium to actual risk especially during market crashes so alright guys hope you enjoyed the video and are staying safe out there be sure to click the like and subscribe button below and also be sure to check out our three free video series by clicking the link in the video description below these videos will help your trading tremendously and they are completely free all you have to do is click the link and put your email and we will send you the three videos so I will see you there ..

hey everyone this is Adam here at skyb trading and in this video we are going to talk about how stop losses actually do the exact opposite of what they're designed to do which is help make you more money by limiting your risk so let's get into it as premium sellers we are always placing high probability trades and as experienced Traders we know that not every trade is going to work out in our favor because as markets fluctuate our positions can go against us so a common theory is to use a stop-loss order to manage or limit yourrisk you know the classic cut your losses small and let your winners run saying but listen guys I absolutely despise the use of a stop loss and I know this may sound contrary to everything you've always heard but stop losses will not help you they will only hurt you so let's get into a few reasons why I don't like stops first let's talk about the stop order itself a stop order is essentially just a market order except it's just triggered when the price touches a certain level so okay not only are stop orders bad but Marketorders in general are just horrible professional Traders just don't use Market orders and there is a good reason when you place a market order you have absolutely no control over where you get filled the counterparty can fill you at whatever price they want to sure you might have faster execution but you're going to pay a big amount for that especially over a large number number of Trades so just take my advice and stick to using a limit order if you don't fill you can always cancel and replace theorder at a different price and you know I get it you may be away from internet access and maybe having a stop order in place just makes you feel more comfortable and if anything this should be the only reason you would ever use a stop loss but still at that I would highly advise against them especially when trading options so I explained why stop orders are bad but what about the use of a mental stop loss which is mostly just a mental agreement with yourself that if the stock or option gets to a certain point you'll exit theposition and take the loss well here's my take on focusing on cutting losses in an effort to limit your risk but first let me just ask you if you like a stock to the long side at $50 why would you not like it even more at $45 I'm not saying you double down or anything like that I'm just saying wouldn't you still want to have the bullish position don't get caught up in the fact that you know it could be breaking down or whatever that's a game that 90% of Traders play and that's why 90% ofTraders lose money you'll never time the tops and bottoms perfectly anyways now let's get into a more technical explanation about the negative aspects of stops I've proved in another video that the probabilities given to us in the option chain are very accurate but let me briefly explain these probabilities for those who haven't seen that video so there are two probability measures probability of a touch is the probability that the stock will touch that strike at some point during the expiration cycle and probability in themoney is the probability that the stock will expire at least one penny beyond that strike at expiration now what's important is that probability of a touch is approximately two times probability in the money this is because Market direction is a 50/50 bet which makes sense right because for example let's say the at the money strike has a probability of a touch of 100% you know because it's at the money it's already touching so if the market is 50/50 then wouldn't the probability of expiring in the money be50% right because it has a 50% chance of going up or down from that level so just remember the probability of a stock touching a certain level is double the probability of a stock expiring beyond that level and guys I know this stuff is kind of heavy especially if you're new to this but if you need to just rewind the video and rewatch it and think through it and it should make sense okay moving on so let's say you sell an option that puts your break even at the probability in the money of 30% so you have a 30% chance of losingmoney and you have a 70% chance of making money well even though you only have a 30% chance of losing money you have a 60% chance that your break even will get tested so to put it simply 50% of all your winning trades will be tested at some point during the life of the trade now just think about that so let's make it simple and say you decide to cut your losses when your break even stock price is tested that means your percentage of profitable trades will be cut and half so if you have a winning percentage of 70% you now only have awinning percentage of 35% that's a huge deal so anytime you go into a trade with a plan of stopping out at a certain point you're going to be significantly decreasing your winning percentage on the flip side anytime you focus on taking profits early you're going to be significantly improving your winning percentage also let me just point out that focusing on losses all the time is a huge psychological mistake it will put you in the wrong frame of mind and cause you to make bad decisions and acquiregray hair at a young age from all the stress okay so all of the probabilities and everything make sense but how do we manage risk then well risk is not managed after you enter the position it can only be managed before you enter the position through proper position sizing with a defined risk trade you know your exact risk R when you enter the position so just size your position accordingly now risk is also managed through a number of uncorrelated positions and this is covered in a separate video but this goes hand inand with positionsizing lots of small uncorrelated positions is your best way to manage risk and smooth out your consistency in your trading so to wrap the video up I'm not saying there is never a time you'll take the loss and move on you know maybe you need to free up some capital or maybe you no longer have the same opinion on the stock whatever it may be there might be certain times that it makes sense to take the loss and move on all I'm saying is that you should not make cutting losses a large focus of your trading most people beat themselvesup thinking they should have cut the loss sooner or they took profits too early and the stop kept going but so what because you can't predict any of that anyways you should be doing the exact opposite so here are the key takeaways number one be patient with your losing trades number two be aggressive with taking profits three trade small enough to have the flexibility to let your positions play out and lastly stay active by putting on more uncorrelated positions Sometimes the best thing to do when you're gettingimpatient with a trade is to just put on another trade this will keep you occupied instead of staring at your losing positions all day and freaking out so all right guys hope that helps if you have any questions make sure to reach out to me and I will see you in the next video [Music]
