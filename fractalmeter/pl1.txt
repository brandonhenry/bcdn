Based on Fractal Flow - Pro Trading Strategies. Step 1: Pre-Market Preparation: Identify Suitable Stocks: Criteria include stocks that have pulled back significantly but show strong support, priced affordably (e.g., $5-$20). Actions: Scan for stocks meeting criteria, analyze price movements and volume for support levels, ensure liquid options with tight bid-ask spreads. Analyze Technical Indicators: Check momentum indicators for signs of positive momentum or potential reversal, identify key support levels. Actions: Confirm stock is at or near strong support and ensure no immediate negative catalysts (e.g., earnings or adverse news). Set Up Data Feeds: Access real-time stock prices and options chain data, and initialize technical analysis tools. Step 2: Option Selection Criteria: Determine Expiration Date: Choose options expiring in 1-6 weeks (ideally 30 days) to benefit from accelerated time decay (Theta). Select Strike Prices: For Short Put, choose a strike price below the current stock price near support. For Long Put, choose a strike price lower than the short put. Actions: Analyze the options chain for suitable strikes with sufficient liquidity. Ensure Affordability: The maximum loss should fit within capital constraints, and the net premium received should provide acceptable ROI. Step 3: Calculate Potential Profit and Loss: Calculate Net Credit: Formula: Net Credit = Premium Received (Short Put) - Premium Paid (Long Put). Example: $30 - $8 = $22. Determine Maximum Loss: Formula: Max Loss = (Strike Price of Short Put - Strike Price of Long Put) x 100 - Net Credit. Example: ($8 - $7) x 100 - $22 = $78. Calculate Break-Even Point: Formula: Break-Even = Strike Price of Short Put - (Net Credit / 100). Example: $8 - $0.22 = $7.78. Assess ROI: Formula: ROI = (Net Credit / Max Loss) x 100%. Example: ($22 / $78) x 100% â‰ˆ 28%. Step 4: Execute the Trade: Place the Spread Order: Enter a vertical put credit spread order, selling the $8 put and buying the $7 put. Set the desired net credit as the limit price. Confirm Order Details: Verify strike prices, expiration date, and net credit. Record Entry Details: Log entry details, including date, time, stock symbol, strike prices, expiration date, net credit, and trade rationale. Step 5: Monitor the Position: Regular Monitoring: Monitor once daily if the position is safe (stock price above short put strike). Increase monitoring if stock approaches the short put strike. Parameters: Track stock price movement and market news. Scenario Analysis: If stock price increases or stays above the short put strike, hold for profit. If price approaches the short put strike, monitor closely. If price falls below the short put strike, evaluate closing or rolling the position. Step 6: Managing the Position: Closing Early: Close both legs if the stock shows signs of continued decline or losses approach 50% of max loss. Rolling the Position: If recovery is expected, close the current spread and open a new spread at lower strikes or later expiration. Ensure the new spread provides additional credit or reduces potential loss. Step 7: Risk Management: Set Loss Limits: Limit losses to a predefined threshold (e.g., 50% of max loss). Avoid Holding In-the-Money Positions: Close positions before expiration if the short put is in-the-money to avoid assignment. Emotional Discipline: Stick to the plan and base decisions on predefined criteria. Step 8: Trade Exit Criteria: Profit Realization: Close early if 80% of max profit is collected to reduce risk and free capital. Expiration: Allow options to expire worthless if conditions are safe. Loss Mitigation: Close the position if the stock falls below the break-even point without signs of recovery. Step 9: Post-Trade Analysis: Evaluate the Trade: Analyze performance, factors influencing success or failure, and lessons learned. Record Keeping: Update the trading journal with entry/exit points, profit/loss, and trade rationale. Step 10: Continuous Improvement: Education: Study materials on options strategies, technical analysis, and risk management. Practice Rolling Techniques: Simulate rolling positions to understand mechanics and outcomes. Expand Strategy Portfolio: As capital grows, consider diversifying strategies to manage risk. Additional Considerations: Automate execution by scanning for suitable stocks and calculating metrics. Address risks, such as assignment for in-the-money options and liquidity concerns. Ensure compliance with margin requirements and day trading regulations. Communicate with AI Assistant: Clearly define terms and criteria for stock selection, strike prices, and expiration dates. Establish decision protocols for when to hold, close, or adjust positions. Set alerts for significant price movements or required actions. By following this structured approach, the "Poor Man's Put Credit Spread" strategy can be executed effectively, ensuring consistency, risk management, and growth potential for small portfolios.
