welcome to the world of unusual options activity where we look through options chains searching for anomalies that might be indicative of insider trading or even just sophisticated speculators that might have information that we don't what's up everyone Eric here from es invest YouTube channel I am an options Trader by trade I've been doing this for over 16 years now and this is a big part of the process actually looking for opportunity this way and it's because options chains are actually verytelling there's a lot of details you can find and it's because they provide a liquid leveraged place to speculate so very frequently when somebody has a really solid dip or if somebody has Insider information that technically is illegal for them to act upon you'll see them turn to options markets pretty frequently and it's for those two reasons now as you all know before we get into weeds here we got to start with a good old bar chart disclaimer which is I am not part of bar chart I enjoy creating content with them however I'mjust a normal Trader like most of us so I have no Financial advice to give you this is all for educational purposes only okay so let's kind of discuss what this is unusual options activity comes in a lot of different forms and flavors you can kind of look for different things as well depending on what it is you're trying to find and what kind of anomalies you're looking to trade here are a couple really common ones so abnormal options trading patterns which I'll kind of get into a little moredetail what that is in general you'll find expressions of it through things like really high volume relative to what you typically see you will find maybe an expiration that otherwise was kind of dead and all of a sudden that's where everybody is trading tons of volume in a specific expiration cycle you can also look for really big block trades a lot of times that will stem from an Institutional position now it's really important to note this is not like the Holy Grail of trading options this isway more kind of detective work that we try to assess a probabilistic scenario because what that means is for example if we see a massive large block trade come through it's some institution that wants to put on a big position for whatever reason that for whatever reason part is super important because even if it's long calls and we think wow that's like super bullish they really want this thing to go up maybe they know something we don't maybe maybe they don't maybe they have a bunch of other positions onand they're actually using this as a hedge in some capacity to reduce risk that's the point is you can't just look at it and take it at face value you have to try and look a little deeper and see what you can find and kind of piece the whole thing together the other really big interesting thing you can look for are big changes in volume open interest and I'll show you some ways we can look for this kind of stuff now the other thing that is interesting to keep an eyeball on is implied volatility thiscan be implied volatility for individual options it could be for the entire options chain and the reason why this matters is because Market market makers people who are forecasting volatility and then baking that into an options price they're pretty smart and what they're doing is taking all the information that they have based on all the order flow that they're seeing based on the options that they have out at a given point in time and they're monitoring the market they will update their models andit's important because their models represent probabilistic outcomes that's what implied volatility is forward-looking volatility it's an expectation of variance over a certain time frame so if we see implied volatility that used to be really low for an expiration cycle and then it's super high something's going on we don't always know exactly what but we know something is going on there same thing where a lot of times if you're looking at an options chain you can find certain expiration cycles that have reallyelevated implied volatility a lot of times it's because that's where earnings actually might be coming out pretty soon those kinds of things so unusual options activity essentially is when we take a baseline assessment of whatever we're looking at typically it's done through different scans which barchart has some great tools I'm going to show you in a minute to help with this process and it looks for anomalous circumstances so why should we care well it's because there are tradable opportunities here there's the abilityto kind of ride the coat tail of informed speculators and you'll actually find a lot of research which I'm going to pull these up so that you can take a look for yourself I always tell people you shouldn't take my word for anything anything that somebody says in these capacities you should be able to assess for yourself and come to a similar conclusion and that's kind of the point of these different studies for you because it highlights the propensity for what kind of transactions we see frominside options trades or just informed trading you can find positive correlation to take over announcements you can find the frequencies that insiders use Insider information and they leverage that through derivatives you can find how informative option pricing is for future returns so you can poke through these and kind of see what you come up with but there's a entire breath of research out there on using derivatives for this kind of thing so now that we understand that there's an opportunity of sorts here let's talkabout how we can use it now the way I look at this is these are very speculative trades it's similar where we're kind of piecing together breadcrumbs and we don't know with certainty if something means big trade comes through and if that means that it's bullish bearish you can come up with some ideas so here are some really basic starting principles you can employ looking for a really big volume that is anomalous looking for really high open interest changes these things have to be taken in contextthough so for example unusual volume could just be people exiting positions because they're in profit or because we're coming up on an expiration cycle or if you're looking at options on Futures it could be that we're just rolling out into the next period same thing for big changes in open interest you'll kind of see that happened a lot in front month expirations but sometimes you'll also see a ton of opening trades in front month expirations and that could be people speculating so it's anuanced skill set and again bar chart has some really cool things to help us start this process so on the options tab here you can look for a lot of different things which is actually really cool if we start here with unusual options Activity one of my favorite scans to start with is volume over open interest and this is because you have the opportunity to then decipher maybe something that was relatively quiet not too long ago but then for some reason is become exceedingly active and that's actually happening right here inWF the previous open interest was 125 contracts the volume for today was 11,45 massive massive volume today relative to the open interest now there are different ways you can decipher if the volume is either buying at the offer or selling at the bid which is important because that tells us how we're opening the trade are we buying to open or selling to open if you buy to open a call typically we assume that that's a bullish position and if you're selling to open it's a bearish position anotherimportant piece of detail that we can decipher is what is the probability that we're seeing volume that's establishing new positions whether it's buying to open or selling to open but then also what are we doing with existing position because if we look at an example this is a good one 65,000 volume against 1185 oi we don't inherently know how much of this 65,000 volume is establishing new positions versus closing out existing ones but again if we apply that same methodology Let's Pretend1,185 of these volume traded today were closing out all of the existing positions which is low probability that still means that there's massive opening trade volume again and that can be broken down either into selling to open or buying to open for that we would see if we transacted at the bid or the ask and then make an inference for things that are transacting closer to the midpoint you can't really tell but you can still get some ideas if something is transacting closer to the bid or closer to the offerso let's take a look at what that looks like if we pop over here now and for ter wolf all I did was go down here to time and sales and I'm grabbing the details from this so we know that the six calls expiring in 19 July saw a lot of activity today so what happened well we can see a big order that got pushed through at 10:41 we see that 11,250 all came through at once and the trade price was at 38 the bid was 30 and the offer was 40 so we can make a pretty good inference here that we're transacting much closer tothe offer than the bid so this is a really interesting thing that you can kind of start right away very simply you can also have it automatically shoot you an email with the specific criteria that you're interested in seeing but this is one that I recommend just start looking at whether or not you trade off of it completely different but it is really interesting and it's also highly informative even if it's something that you don't put a trade on you can still learn a lot about a company especiallysomething like P10 if we see this kind of huge volume and you're like H these are 51 days out that's really interesting and this is a lot of puts so what's going on here and you might learn something that you want to put a position on or you might just learn something about that company that could be interesting for another thesis further down the line so unusual options activity is actually super informative there's a lot you can glean from it to integrate into your trading as always if you have any questions throw them in thecomments be an outlier we'll see you guys later
