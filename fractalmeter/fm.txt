Based on Fractal Flow - Pro Trading Strategies. 1. Head and Shoulders Pattern: A reversal pattern indicating a potential change from an uptrend to a downtrend, consisting of three peaks: a higher peak (head) between two lower peaks (shoulders). The "neckline" connects the lows of the two troughs between the peaks. Implementation tips: Identify peaks and troughs using high (h) and low (l) values over time. Detect pattern structure where the left shoulder forms with a peak, the head forms with a higher peak, and the right shoulder forms with a peak similar in height to the left shoulder. Confirm the pattern by monitoring the close (c) price for a breakout below the neckline. 2. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern: A reversal pattern signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend, consisting of three troughs: a deeper trough (head) between two higher troughs (shoulders). Implementation tips: Identify troughs using low (l) values over time. Detect the pattern structure where the left shoulder forms with a trough, the head forms with a lower trough, and the right shoulder forms with a trough similar in depth to the left shoulder. Confirm the pattern by monitoring the close (c) price for a breakout above the neckline. 3. Double Top Pattern: A bearish reversal pattern indicating potential trend reversal from uptrend to downtrend, characterized by two consecutive peaks at a similar price level. Implementation tips: Identify peaks using high (h) values. Confirm the pattern with a moderate decline between the two peaks. Monitor the close (c) price breaking below the support level (neckline). 4. Double Bottom Pattern: A bullish reversal pattern signaling potential trend reversal from downtrend to uptrend, characterized by two consecutive troughs at a similar price level. Implementation tips: Identify troughs using low (l) values. Confirm the pattern with a moderate rise between the two troughs. Monitor the close (c) price breaking above the resistance level. 5. Triple Top and Triple Bottom Patterns: Similar to Double Top/Bottom but with three peaks (Triple Top) or troughs (Triple Bottom), indicating a stronger potential reversal. Implementation tips: Track multiple peaks/troughs using high (h) and low (l) values to identify three similar peaks or troughs. Monitor for a breakout from the established support/resistance level. 6. Rising Wedge Pattern: A bearish reversal pattern where price moves upward between converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. Implementation tips: Plot trendlines connecting higher highs and higher lows using high (h) and low (l) values. Ensure the trendlines are converging, with the slope of the lower trendline steeper than the upper. Confirm with a close (c) price breaking below the lower trendline. 7. Falling Wedge Pattern: A bullish reversal pattern where price moves downward between converging trendlines, suggesting a potential upward breakout. Implementation tips: Plot trendlines using high (h) and low (l) values to draw trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows. Ensure trendlines are converging, with the slope of the upper trendline steeper than the lower. Monitor the close (c) price breaking above the upper trendline. 8. Bullish and Bearish Rectangles: Continuation patterns where price moves sideways within horizontal support and resistance levels. Bullish Rectangle expects an upward breakout, and Bearish Rectangle expects a downward breakout. Implementation tips: Identify sideways movement by observing high (h) and low (l) values within a narrow range. Define support and resistance using consistent highs and lows. Watch for close (c) price breakouts. 9. Bullish and Bearish Flags: Continuation patterns following a sharp price movement (the flagpole), resembling a small rectangle or parallelogram sloping against the prevailing trend. Implementation tips: Identify the flagpole with a strong upward (bullish) or downward (bearish) movement in close (c) prices. Detect flag formation with a consolidation period moving in a channel opposite the trend. Confirm continuation with a breakout in the initial trend direction. 10. Bullish and Bearish Pennants: Similar to flags but with converging trendlines forming a small symmetrical triangle, indicating trend continuation after brief consolidation. Implementation tips: Identify the flagpole using close (c) prices. Detect the pennant shape with converging trendlines using high (h) and low (l) values. Confirm breakout with close (c) price moving in the prior trend direction. General strategies include data preprocessing to organize stock data chronologically, implementing pattern recognition algorithms, performing statistical analysis, and integrating machine learning models to improve detection accuracy.
