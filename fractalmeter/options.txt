so you just bought your dream car you buy a brand new Maserati and to protect your new Maserati you need insurance so you go to Flow from Progressive and you purchase insurance this financially protects your new Maserati in case you get into a crash and this is the exact same concept as options now instead of a car Enthusiast let's say you're an investor and you just bought $112,500 worth of Apple stock that's $122,500 in Risk now just like the Maserati you can buy insurance on your investment this is called a putoption so if you buy an option then someone had to have sold it to you but who the answer is any other Trader who is willing to be paid to take on your risk just like an insurance provider that's the basic idea of options an investor has risk but he's willing to pay someone to take away his risk and the person who gets paid now assumes his risk now let's look at a real example you bought 100 shares of Apple stock at $125 per share this cost you $122,500 and you also buy a put option as insurance for let's say$500 now I'm going to give you two different scenarios in the first scenario after you own the stock and the option the stock ends up going to $132 per share so you made $700 on the stock but you paid $500 for an option that now has no value to you so your net profit is $200 now you might be saying what a ripoff and the person who sold you the option is saying thanks for the easy money but let's look at a different scenario this time Apple stock price drops to $113 per share and your stock is now worth $12 $1200 less than you paid forit but thankfully you bought this option as insurance you go to the person who sold you the option and you say hey remember our contract you can exercise your option you bought and even though apple is at $13 you can immediately sell your shares at $125 per share so now your only loss is the money you paid for the option which is $500 much better than the $1,200 loss you would have had if you did not purchase the option now the person who sold you the option was obligated to buy your stock from you at $125 per share sothey kept the $500 you paid them for the option but they are now sitting on a $1,200 loss on the stock they own they can hold the stock and hope it goes back up or they can sell it at the current market price of 113 for a net loss of $700 now the cool thing about options is that you don't have to own stock to trade them and they aren't actually physical pieces of paper it's all done virtually you can trade them in and out of the Market within a few milliseconds at the click of your mouse


now that you understand why options exist I'm going to show you ways you can trade options to make a profit so most of your favorite companies that you use everyday have stock options and you can trade them right from your computer cell phone or tablet there are two types of options there are calls and puts if you buy call you want the stock to go up if you buy a put you want the stock to go down now since there are two sides to every market you can also do the opposite where you would sell the option as an opening trade and hopefully buy itback at a lower price as a closing trade this will make more sense in a second option prices are based on three elements of its underlying stock the first one is time to expiration in the last video we talked about how options are basically insurance and of course you pay money for this insurance now the thing about insurance is you don't just get to pay a one-time payment and have insurance forever you have to pay month after month to keep your insurance so the longer you have it the more money you will have to pay options are thesame way they have expiration dates for the exact same reason you have to pay monthly for car insurance an option with 60 days until expiration might cost $500 when the option with only 30 days to expiration only cost $250 so more time equals more money so naturally as time passes an options time value will decay this is known as time decay now let's take a look at how an options time value will decay over time the curve will look something like this as you can see time decay isn't linear it's exponentialmeaning that as you get closer to expiration time decay will rapidly speed up the important thing for you to understand right now is that an options time value is always decaying 100% of the time every day every hour this can be your worst enemy if you trade options the wrong way or it can be a huge advantage if you trade them correctly which I'll show you in the next few videos most stocks have options with weekly monthly and quarterly expirations and you can choose whatever expert you want to trade in and some of myother videos I talked about the best expiration that provides the lowest risk and the highest returns so be sure to check those out so the second factor that goes into option pricing is the price of the underlying stock itself for each stock there are multiple options at different price increments these are called the options strike price the strike price is the predetermined price at which the shares of stock will be exchanged if the option is exercised for example if you own the stock at $125 per share you could buy the 125-foot becausethat's where you could sell your shares in case the stock goes lower and you need to exercise your option so again the strike price is simply the price that the shares of stock will be exchanged if the option is exercised of course you don't have to own shares of stock to trade options but the strike price of the option you're trading has a huge effect on what the options price will be let me explain let's say the current stock price is 125 dollars per share for call options any option that has a strike price above the currentstock price is referred to as out of the money it's a strike prices below the stock's price it is referred to as in the money and for put options it's the exact opposite I know this is a lot to digest right now but soon it will become second nature so here's an idea of what each options price will look like with let's say 30 days to expiration and just a quick note each option contract represents 100 shares of stock so these prices have a multiplier of 100 so for example if you buy one contract of the125 call this will actually cost you 500 dollars not $5 so here's the thing all out of the money options have no value at expiration let me repeat if an option is out of the money at the expiration date it will be worthless so if they won't have any value at the expiration then why did it have value now because stock prices move and there is a chance that the out of the money options could become in the money if there is still time left to expiration now you can see that the further out of the money an option isthe cheaper it is that's because the likelihood of it being of any value is less than an option that is closer to the stock price right because for example this stock is more likely to get to 130 than it is to 135 and as stock prices move on a day-to-day basis the option prices will also move if the stock goes up the calls will become more expensive and the puts will become cheaper and vice-versa now a common misconception is that you have to hold your position until the expiration this isn't true if you buy a call optiontoday that expires in 30 days and the stock goes up overnight and your call option is now worth $100 more than it was when you bought it you can sell it for a profit the expiration date of 30 days does not mean that you have to hold the position that long now you see the prices of these options with 30 days left until expiration let's take a look at what these option prices will look like with 0 days left you can see all out of the money options are worthless and the end the money options are worth the difference between the stock and thestrike price this is because since there is no time left there is no time value left on these options this is also referred to as extrinsic value the third and final factor that goes into option pricing is volatility volatility is referred to as the magnitude of a stock's price swings higher volatility means bigger price swings and ultimately more risk for the investor who own stock since there is more risk involved options will be more expensive why would the option sell or not demand more money if they're taking more risk let meexplain I know you're probably sick of the insurance analogy by now but let's say you are providing life insurance for two different people the first person is overweight smokes a pack a day and has a medical condition and the second person is healthy exercises regularly and has no signs of any life-threatening medical conditions now who do you think we'll have to pay more for life insurance exactly the person who is at more risk of dying now think of this person as a stock with high volatility and this one as a stock with lowvolatility now different stocks have different volatilities but volatility is something that moves around a stock with low volatility now might have high volatility in the future volatility is much more predictable than stock prices so if you're trading options it's important to position yourself on the right side of volatility this is a backbone of my trading strategy which you'll learn about in the next few videos and the combination of these three elements is what determines option prices [Music]
