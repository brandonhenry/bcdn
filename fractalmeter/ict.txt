Based on Fractal Flow - Pro Trading Strategies. 1. Swing Highs and Swing Lows: Swing High is a peak point where the price reaches a high before declining, with the central candle having a higher high than the candles immediately before and after it. Swing Low is a trough point where the price reaches a low before rising, with the central candle having a lower low than the candles immediately before and after it. Implementation tips: Loop through price data (highs "h" and lows "l") and compare each candle with the previous and next candles. Detect Swing High if h[i-1] < h[i] > h[i+1] and Swing Low if l[i-1] > l[i] < l[i+1]. Use in liquidity concepts to identify areas where stop-loss orders are likely placed. 2. Buy-Side and Sell-Side Liquidity: Buy-Side Liquidity exists just above swing highs where buy stop orders are placed, and Sell-Side Liquidity exists just below swing lows where sell stop orders are placed. Implementation tips: Mark levels above swing highs and below swing lows as potential liquidity zones and monitor price action near these zones for potential liquidity sweeps. 3. Equal Highs and Equal Lows: Equal Highs are multiple swing highs at similar price levels, and Equal Lows are multiple swing lows at similar levels. Implementation tips: Group swing highs/lows within a small price range to identify accumulated liquidity zones, often acting as strong support/resistance or liquidity hunt targets. 4. Old Highs and Old Lows: Prominent, isolated swing highs or lows that stand out on the chart. Implementation tips: Mark these levels as magnets for price, where liquidity may rest, and price might revisit. 5. Liquidity Sweeps and Market Manipulation: Liquidity Sweep occurs when price moves beyond a swing high/low to trigger stop orders and then reverses. Market Manipulation involves large players capturing liquidity before moving the price. Implementation tips: Detect sharp moves breaking swing highs/lows but not sustaining beyond them and use these reversals as entry signals. 6. Premium and Discount Zones: Defined by a swing high and swing low range. The Premium Zone (upper half) is good for selling, and the Discount Zone (lower half) is good for buying. Implementation tips: Calculate the 50% level of the range and focus on buying in the discount zone and selling in the premium zone. 7. Optimal Trade Entry (OTE): A Fibonacci retracement zone between 62% and 79% of a price range. Implementation tips: After identifying a swing high and swing low, calculate Fibonacci levels. For long entries, focus on retracements to the OTE zone within the discount zone. For short entries, focus on retracements within the premium zone. 8. Fair Value Gap (FVG): A three-candle pattern with a gap between the first and third candle's wicks, indicating a market imbalance. Implementation tips: Identify bullish FVG when high[i-1] < low[i+1] and bearish FVG when low[i-1] > high[i+1]. Mark FVG zones as areas where price may retrace before continuing its trend. 9. Consequent Encroachment: The midpoint (50% level) of an FVG, acting as a significant reversal level. Implementation tips: Calculate (Upper Limit + Lower Limit) / 2 for the FVG and use the midpoint as a potential entry or exit point. 10. Volume Imbalances and Gaps: Volume Imbalances occur between open and close of adjacent candles with overlapping wicks, while Gaps are between the high of one candle and the low of the next with no overlap. Implementation tips: Identify and mark these areas as support/resistance zones where price may fill gaps or react. 11. Order Blocks: High Probability Order Blocks are large-body candles sweeping liquidity and leading to a break of structure. Bullish Order Blocks form after a down move sweeping sell-side liquidity, followed by a break above a swing high. Bearish Order Blocks form after an up move sweeping buy-side liquidity, followed by a break below a swing low. Implementation tips: Identify large candles sweeping liquidity and confirm breaks of structure. Mark the order block at the open of the large candle, and calculate its mean threshold (50% level) for entry points. 12. Break of Structure (BOS): Occurs when price breaks a significant swing high/low, signaling a potential market structure change. Implementation tips: Monitor for price closing beyond a swing high (bullish BOS) or swing low (bearish BOS) and use this to validate order blocks or other patterns. 13. Daily Bias: Predicts whether the next trading day will be bullish or bearish based on the previous day's high and low. Implementation tips: Bullish Bias is set if the price closes above the previous high or breaks the previous low but fails to close below it. Bearish Bias is set if the price closes below the previous low or breaks the previous high but fails to close above it. Use the bias to align intraday trades. 14. Combining Concepts for Trade Setups: Use the intersection of techniques (e.g., order block within an OTE zone at a liquidity level) for high-probability trades. General implementation strategies include preprocessing data (e.g., cleaning, calculating moving averages), implementing pattern recognition algorithms, and conducting multi-timeframe analysis for reliability. Use backtesting to evaluate and validate performance. Incorporate risk management through stop-losses, take-profit levels, and position sizing. Monitor volume analysis to confirm moves and validate signals.
